# Welcome to Stage 1


I'm working on a redesign of the site based around my concept of a virtual workshop. In my workshop I have all my projects, my notes, my tools, relevant references, and, ideally, detailed guides from past projects. I want to build the site around these same areas.

This is currently stage 1, which is just a basic blog built off of the [Gatsby Starter Blog starter](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/). This part will eventually turn into the notes section of the site.

Like a workshop, this site will be organized around projects. There will a section for every project I'm working on. Completed projects will be turned into guides.

Blog posts will be in the notes section, sometimes they will relate to current or past projects and will be linked appropratly. Other times, they will just be one whatever topic is on my mind.

The tools and references section(s) might be one section or seperated into two. Tools will include links to all the tools, both software or phyiscal, that I have found useful in my projects, again with links to any relevant projects. References will be links to any documentation or other web tutorials I've found useful, as well has to other tech blogs and sites that I've found informative.

And since this site is going to be organized around projects, the redesign of the site is the first project I'll be documenting, starting with this post about the plan.

So, welcome to the start on the new ngraton.dev, stick around, and expect a lot of changes.
